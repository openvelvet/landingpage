You're inspiring and a thought leader. The shopping experience in the store, app, or website is far superior to any other retailer. It's the attention to detail at Nordstrom that keeps me shopping there ever since I've had a job.

I'm a first time entrepreneur and I just started to build my product. I'm looking for direct and honest feedback before I spent too much time building something no retailer wants :)

Here's my idea: An app for mobile shoppers to find and buy any item available in-store from any retailer. Nordstrom would expand its reach, drive foot-traffic, and improve the shopping experience for any customer who doesn't have the Nordstrom app. Customers get real-time access to inventory and pricing for any item available in-store. They can choose the "buy online, pickup in-store" option or get directions to the nearest Nordstrom.

Can you imagine Nordstrom partnering with an app like this or am I just waisting my time here?

Thank you,
Omar Amiri

I don't think this will ever reach you but I'm going to try.

You're inspiring, a thought leader and set the standard for dedication to a company. In one of the most competitive markets you're continuing to succeed. Focusing on the customer experience and cultivating your own product lines was a great decision.

Body: Hi Hubert,

You're inspiring and a real leader. When everyone expected Best Buy to fade into the dust like Circuit City and Radio Shack you had a vision, made the right decisions and drastically improved the future for Best Buy.

I'm a first time entrepreneur and I just started to build my product. I'm looking for direct and honest feedback before I spent too much time building something no retailer wants :)

Here's my idea: An app for mobile shoppers to find and buy any item available in-store from any retailer. It's an extension of the current features the Best Buy app offers but for multiple retailers. Customers get real-time access to inventory and pricing for any item available in-store. They can choose the "buy online, pickup in-store" option or get directions to the nearest Best Buy.

Can you imagine Best Buy partnering with an app like this or am I just waisting my time here?

Body: I really appreciate retail executives like yourself who believe in innovation. The HEB app is one of the only grocery apps that provides more than just coupons, recipes, and store directions. I watched a YouTube video where you said innovation is taking a look at a consumer need that's not been met and flipping it around by finding new ways to think about it so that need is met. 

The unmet need is consumers having to download multiple apps or visit multiple websites to find and buy specific items available in-store. We're building an app where mobile shoppers get real-time access to inventory, pricing, and aisle location within the store for any item like the HEB app, but we make it available for all retailers. Customers can also choose to buy online and pickup in store or get directions to the nearest HEB.

The benefit to you would be to improve the shopping experience, expand your reach, and drive foot-traffic to HEB stores for all mobile shoppers who don't have the HEB app.   

We're looking to partner with innovative retailers like HEB.

Are you free for a 10 minute phone call sometime this week between 2pm-4:30pm CST?

I read in an article how you and your family escaped the Iranian Revolution back in 1978 and eventually settled in LA. My family and I escaped Afghanistan in 1989 during the war with Russia, moved to Germany and finally settled in LA as well. You've successfully created shopping companies and now one of the most downloaded apps with Flipagram with several failures in between. You have the experience, wisdom, and knowledge in both areas my startup in working on which is a shopping app to find and buy any available item at nearby stores.
