Body: I read the Forbes article on how convenience can be emotional and was really impressed by your answers. As a User Experience Designer, I really appreciate the small details you're considering to improve the shopping experience at Walgreens like the planogram to navigate through aisles or switching out the older shopping baskets for rolling baskets. I was surprised not to see User Experience Designer on your LinkedIn profile because you definitely think like one.

Body: I'm really impressed by your belief of retailers having to be tech companies and how you've implemented a startup culture at Target. The features and products you're releasing are definitely industry leading.

We're building an app like the Target app but across multiple retailers in one. So the mobile shoppers who don't have the Target app can find and buy any item that's available in-store when they need it.
