Body: I read the Forbes article on how convenience can be emotional and was really impressed by your answers. As a User Experience Designer, I really appreciate the small details you're considering to improve the shopping experience at Walgreens like the planogram to navigate through aisles or switching out the older shopping baskets for rolling baskets. I was surprised not to see User Experience Designer on your LinkedIn profile because you definitely think like one. 

We're building an all-in-one shopping app that lets people browse for items on their phones and then choose to pick them up in-store or self-checkout from different retailers. Shoppers are able to access real-time inventory, pricing and aisle location for any given item. Overall, our goal is to drive sales by improving the customer shopping experience.

Are you free for a 10 minute phone call?

Body: Congratulations on winning the 2015 Internet Retailer of the Year award. From a UX Designers perspective, I'm really impressed with the Home Depot app on how user-friendly and intuitive it is. With all the items Home Depot has available, making the design scalable and consistent is a big challenge and I think you and your team nailed it. 

We're building a similar app where shoppers can get real-time inventory, pricing, and aisle location of items but across a variety of retailers. This way people can see which local stores have a specific drill or a pair of shoes and then select whether they want to pick it up or self-checkout at the store. Overall, our goal is to drive sales by improving the customer shopping experience.
